# NLP-332-Final-Project

#### Background & Motivation
The jewelry industry is experiencing a major shift driven by the rapid rise of lab-grown diamonds, marketed as affordable and ethically sourced alternatives to natural diamonds. At the same time, fluctuating gold prices and growing social awareness around sustainability are influencing how consumers make high-value purchasing decisions, particularly for symbolic products such as engagement rings.
Traditional customer feedback sources (e.g., store reviews, surveys) tend to be brief, promotional, or biased by purchase experiences. By contrast, online discussion communities such as Reddit’s r/Diamonds offer spontaneous, detailed conversations where people openly express excitement, hesitation, regret, ethical concerns, and financial constraints regarding diamond purchases. These discussions represent authentic sentiment that can guide strategic decision-making for jewelry retailers.
